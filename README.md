## Development Setup

  1. Install dependencies with `yarn install`
  2. Run `yarn run build`. This helps with [RLS](https://github.com/rust-lang/rls-vscode), as well as being able to run `cargo build` without re-packaging

## Running the application

  1. Run `yarn start`

  2. Alternatively, you can also serve the frontend using `parcel index.html`
